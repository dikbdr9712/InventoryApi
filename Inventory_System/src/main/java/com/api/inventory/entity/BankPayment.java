 * A payment from the customer's own bank account through the payment gateway (RMA Payment Gateway):

 * Stored: the bank, the LAST 4 digits of the account, the gateway's transaction number and what happened.
 * Never stored: the full account number or the one-time code.

 *   STARTED -> CODE_SENT -> PAID
